# deadend

My deadend of frontend.

## Motivation

Frontend frameworks are overdoing things and too big.

## Concepts

- There is no `Component`, but `view` functions.
- States are managed by `subjects`. Not centralized.
- `observers` watches the state change, and do logics or call `view` functions.
- Aim for less dependencies. Hate npm trash.
